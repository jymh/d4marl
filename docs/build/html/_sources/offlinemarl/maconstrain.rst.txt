Lagrangian Methods Theorem
--------------------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

In the previous introduction of algorithms,
we know that Safe RL mainly solves the constraint optimization problem of CMDP.

.. hint::

    Constrained optimization problems tend to be more challenging than unconstrained optimization problems.

Therefore, the natural idea is to convert a constrained optimization problem
into an unconstrained optimization problem.
Then solve it using classical optimization algorithms,
such as stochastic gradient descent.
Lagrangian methods is a kind of method solving constraint problems that are
widely used in machine learning.
By using adaptive penalty coefficients to enforce constraints,
Lagrangian methods convert the solution of a constrained optimization problem
to the solution of an unconstrained optimization problem.
In this section, we will briefly introduce Lagrangian methods,
and give corresponding implementations in **TRPO** and **PPO**.
TRPO and PPO are the algorithms we introduced earlier.
If you lack understanding of it, it doesn't matter.
Please refer to the :doc:`TRPO tutorial<../baserl/trpo>` and
:doc:`PPO tutorial<../baserl/ppo>`.

            Problems of Lagrangian Methods
            ^^^
            -  Different hyperparameters need to be set for different tasks.

            -  Not necessarily valid for all tasks.

            -  Problems of overshoot.

            -  Difficult to handle multiple cost tasks directly.

Optimization Objective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we mentioned in the previous chapters, the optimization problem of CMDPs can be expressed as follows:


.. math::
    :label: lag-eq-1


    \max_{\pi \in \Pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}} &J^R(\pi) \\
    \text {s.t.}~~& J^{\mathcal{C}}(\pi) \leq d


where :math:`\Pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \subseteq \Pi` denotes the set of parametrized policies with parameters :math:`{\boldsymbol{\theta}}`.
In local policy search for CMDPs,
we additionally require policy iterates to be feasible for the CMDP,
so instead of optimizing over :math:`\Pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}`,
algorithm should optimize over :math:`\Pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \cap \Pi_C`.
Specifically, for the TRPO and PPO algorithms,
constraints on the differences between old and new policies should also be added.
To solve this constrained problem, please read the :doc:`TRPO tutorial<../baserl/trpo>`.
The final optimization goals are as follows:


.. math::
    :label: lag-eq-2

    \pi_{k+1}&=\arg \max _{\pi \in \Pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}} J^R(\pi) \\
    \text { s.t. } ~~ J^{\mathcal{C}}(\pi) &\leq d \\
    D\left(\pi, \pi_k\right) &\leq \delta


where :math:`D` is some distance measure and :math:`\delta` is the step size.

Lagrangian Method Theorem
-------------------------

Lagrangian methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Constrained MDP (CMDP) are often solved using the Lagrange methods.
In Lagrange methods, the CMDP is converted into an equivalent unconstrained problem.
In addition to the objective, a penalty term is added for infeasibility,
thus making infeasible solutions sub-optimal.

    :class-card: sd-outline-info  sd-rounded-1
    :class-footer: sd-font-weight-bold
    :link: lagrange_theorem
    :link-type: ref

    Theorem 1
    ^^^
    Given a CMDP, the unconstrained problem can be written as:

    .. math::
        :label: lag-eq-3

        \min _{\lambda \geq 0} \max _{\boldsymbol{\theta}} G(\lambda, {\boldsymbol{\theta}})=\min _{\lambda \geq 0} \max _{\boldsymbol{\theta}} [J^R(\pi)-\lambda J^C(\pi)]


    where :math:`G` is the Lagrangian and :math:`\lambda \geq 0` is the Lagrange multiplier (a penalty coefficient).
    Notice, as :math:`\lambda` increases, the solution to the Problem :eq:`lag-eq-1` converges to that of the Problem :eq:`lag-eq-3`.
    +++
    The theorem base of :bdg-info:`Theorem 1` can be found in :bdg-info-line:`Lagrange Duality`, click this card to jump to view.

.. hint::

        The Lagrangian method is a **two-step** process.

        - First, we solve the unconstrained problem :eq:`lag-eq-3` to find a feasible solution :math:`{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^*`
        - Then, we increase the penalty coefficient :math:`\lambda` until the constraint is satisfied.

        The final solution is :math:`\left({\boldsymbol{\theta}}^*, \lambda^*\right)`.
        The goal is to find a saddle point :math:`\left({\boldsymbol{\theta}}^*\left(\lambda^*\right), \lambda^*\right)` of the Problem :eq:`lag-eq-1`,
        which is a feasible solution. (A feasible solution of the CMDP is a solution which satisfies :math:`J^C(\pi) \leq d` )

------

Practical Implementation
------------------------

Intuitively, we train the agent to maximize the reward in the classical
strategy gradient descent algorithm.
If a particular action :math:`a` in state :math:`s` can bring a relatively
higher reward,
we increase the probability that the agent will choose action :math:`a` under
:math:`s`,
and conversely, we will reduce this probability.

.. hint::

    Lagrangian methods add two extra steps to the above process.

    - One is to adjust the reward function,
      and if the agent's actions violate the constraint, the reward will reduce accordingly.
    - The second is a slow update of the penalty factor.
      If the agent violates fewer constraints, the penalty coefficient will gradually decrease,
      and conversely, it will gradually increase.

Next we will introduce the specific implementation of the Lagrange method in
the TRPO and PPO algorithms.

Policy update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Fast Step

        .. card::
            :class-header: sd-bg-success sd-text-white sd-font-weight-bold
            :class-card: sd-outline-success  sd-rounded-1
            :class-footer: sd-font-weight-bold

            Surrogate function update
            ^^^
            Previously, in TRPO and PPO, we used to have the agent sample a series of data from the environment,
            and at the end of the episode, use this data to update the agent several times,
            as described in Problem :eq:`lag-eq-2`.
            With the addition of the Lagrange method,
            we need to make a change to the original surrogate function, as it is shown below:

            .. math::

                \max _{\pi \in \prod_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}[J^R(\pi)-\lambda J^C(\pi)] \\
                \text { s.t. } D\left(\pi, \pi_k\right) \leq \delta


            In a word, we only need to punish the agent with its reward by
            :math:`\lambda` with each step of updates. In fact, this is just a minor
            change made on TRPO and PPO.

    .. tab-item:: Slow Step

        .. card::
            :class-header: sd-bg-success  sd-text-white sd-font-weight-bold
            :class-card:  sd-outline-success  sd-rounded-1
            :class-footer: sd-font-weight-bold

            Lagrange multiplier update
            ^^^
            After all rounds of policy updates to the agent are complete, we
            will perform an update on the Lagrange multiplier, that is:

            .. math::

                \min _\lambda(1-\lambda) [J^R(\pi)-\lambda J^C(\pi)] \\
                \text { s.t. } \lambda \geq 0


            Specifically, on the :math:`k^{t h}` update, the above equation is often
            written as below in the actual calculation process:

            .. math::

                \lambda_{k+1}=\max \left(\lambda_k+ \eta_\lambda\left(J^C(\pi)-d\right), 0\right)


            where :math:`\eta_\lambda` is the learning rate of :math:`\lambda`.

            Ultimately, we only need to add the above two steps to the TRPO and PPO;
            then we will get the TRPOLag and the PPOLag.

            .. attention::
                :class: warning

                In practice, we often need to manually set the initial value of as well as the learning rate.
                Unfortunately, Lagrange algorithms are algorithms that **are sensitive to hyperparameter selection**.

                - If the initial value of :math:`\lambda` or learning rate is chosen to be large,
                  the agent may suffer from a low reward.
                - Else, it may violate the constraints.

                So we often struggle to choose a compromise hyperparameter to balance reward and constraints.

Code with OmniSafe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Safe RL algorithms for :bdg-success-line:`TRPO`, :bdg-success-line:`PPO`, :bdg-success-line:`NPG`, :bdg-success-line:`DDPG`, :bdg-success-line:`SAC` and :bdg-success-line:`TD3` are currently implemented in OmniSafe using Lagrangian methods.
This section will explain how to deploy Lagrangian methods on PPO algorithms at the code level using PPOLag as an example.
OmniSafe has :bdg-success:`Lagrange` as a separate module and you can easily deploy it on most RL algorithms.
